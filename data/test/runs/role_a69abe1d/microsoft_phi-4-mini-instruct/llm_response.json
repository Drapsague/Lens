  "raw_content": "Based on the provided code representations, here are the confirmed user-controlled sources and confirmed dangerous sinks:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"confirmed_sources\": [\n    {\"function\": \"com1\", \"parameter\": \"username\" },\n    {\"function\": \"com2\", \"parameter\": \"filename\" }\n  ],\n  \"confirmed_sinks\": [\n    \"os.system\",\n    \"subprocess.call\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe confirmed sources are identified as the parameters `username` and `filename` in the functions `com1` and `com2`, respectively. These parameters are user-controlled inputs that could potentially be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands or access unauthorized files.\n\nThe confirmed sinks are identified as `os.system` and `subprocess.call`, which are functions that can execute system commands. These functions can be dangerous if they are called with untrusted input, as they can lead to command injection vulnerabilities."
