  "raw_content": "Understood. I will analyze the provided code representations to identify confirmed user-controlled sources and dangerous sinks. I will trace both intra-procedural and inter-procedural data flows to determine whether untrusted input can reach sensitive operations. Only those elements I can confirm based on the given code will be included in the final output. I will present my findings using the specified JSON format, listing confirmed sources (function name and parameter) and confirmed sinks (fully qualified dangerous functions).\n\nAfter analyzing the code, I have identified the following confirmed user-controlled sources:\n\n1. Function: `show_user`, Parameter: `username` (in `sql_i.py` at line 5)\n2. Function: `com1`, Parameter: `None` (in `com_i.py` at line 11)\n3. Function: `com2`, Parameter: `None` (in `com_i.py` at line 18)\n4. Function: `path_exists`, Parameter: `None` (in `com_i.py` at line 25)\n5. Function: `show_user`, Parameter: `None` (in `sql_flask_i.py` at line 13)\n6. Function: `code_ex`, Parameter: `None` (in `code_i.py` at line 7)\n\nAnd the following confirmed dangerous sinks:\n\n1. `os.system` (in `com_i.py` at line 14)\n2. `subprocess.Popen` (in `com_i.py` at line 21)\n3. `os.system` (in `com_i.py` at line 31)\n"
