For each internal function:\n   - Check if it accepts parameters that look like user input (e.g., 'request', 'filename', 'query', etc.).\n   - Mark these as potential sources.\n\n   From the input, the following functions have parameters that look like user input:\n   - `show_user` in `sql_i.py` has a parameter `username`.\n   - `com1` and `com2` in `com_i.py` have no parameters, but they are decorated with `app.route`, which suggests they handle HTTP requests.\n   - `path_exists` in `com_i.py` has no parameters, but it is decorated with `app.route` and mentions `os.path.exists` as a sanitizer.\n   - `show_user` in `sql_flask_i.py` has no parameters.\n   - `code_ex` in `code_i.py` has no parameters.\n\n2. For each external API:\n   - Check if it is a known sink (e.g., os.system, eval, pickle.loads, SQL execution, etc.).\n   - If yes, mark it as a confirmed sink.\n\n   From the input, the following external APIs are known sinks:\n   - `os.system` in `com_i.py` (line 14 and 31).\n   - `eval` in `code_i.py` (line 10).\n   - `django.db.connection.cursor.execute` in `sql_i.py` (lines 8, 12, 16, 20).\n   - `django.db.models.Model.objects.raw` in `sql_flask_i.py` (lines 18, 27).\n   - `django.db.models.Model.objects.extra` in `sql_flask_i.py` (line 28).\n\n3. Try to correlate function parameters (sources) to the same file where dangerous APIs (sinks) appear.\n\n   From the input, the following correlations can be made:\n   - In `sql_i.py`, the function `show_user` has a parameter `username`, which is a potential source. The file also contains the sink `django.db.connection.cursor.execute`.\n   - In `com_i.py`, the functions `com1` and `com2` are decorated with `app.route`, which suggests they handle HTTP requests. The file also contains the sink `os.system`.\n   - In `code_i.py`, the function `code_ex` has no parameters, but the file contains the sink `eval`.\n\nBased on the analysis, the confirmed sinks and sources are:\n\n{\n  \"confirmed_sinks\": [\n    \"os.system\",\n    \"eval\",\n    \"django.db.connection.cursor.execute\",\n    \"django.db.models.Model.objects.raw\",\n    \"django.db.models.Model.objects.extra\"\n  ],\n  \"confirmed_sources\": [\n    {\n      \"function\": \"show_user\",\n      \"parameter\": \"username\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"function\": \"com1\",\n      \"parameter\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"function\": \"com2\",\n      \"parameter\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
