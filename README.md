## Project Overview

This repository contains a Proof of Concept research project evaluating a hybrid approach to Static Application Security Testing (SAST). The solution combines the semantic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the formal verification power of the CodeQL engine.

The primary objective is to detect complex, inter-procedural vulnerabilities that standard SAST configurations fail to identify due to a lack of context.
